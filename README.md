# Fine-Tuning the LLaMA2 Model with Gradient.AI for Precise Text Generation

This repository demonstrates the use of Gradient.AI for fine-tuning the LLaMA2 model, a state-of-the-art language model, to produce precise and concise text outputs, specifically for cut-to-cut requirements. By leveraging the advanced tools and user-friendly interface of [Gradient.AI](https://gradient.ai), the LLaMA2 model is optimized to generate straight forward answers to the user inputs.
